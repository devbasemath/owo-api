## Best Practices Features Used

### Automatic restart

This can be done with pm2, thus:-

1.  Install pm2 as a global module

    `npm install pm2 -g`

2.  Launch your process

    `pm2 start server.js`

Or with nodemon, thus:-

1.  Install pm2 as a global module

    `npm install nodemon -g`

2.  Launch your process

    `nodemon server.js`

### Reliability

Cluster the app to improve reliability. To start up multiple instances for each core run:

    `pm2 start server.js -i max`

Or add to script section of package.json

```
"scripts": {
  "start": "pm2 start server.js -i max -f"
}
```

### Security

To secure app in the following ways:-

* XSS Protection
* Prevent Clickingjacking using X-Frame-Options
* Enforcing all connections to be HTTPS
* Setting a Context-Security-Policy header
* Disabling the X-Powered-By header so attackers can’t narrow down their attacks to specific software

1.  Using `helmet` that is, install it:-

    `yarn add helmet`

2.  In code when setting up Express add:-

```
  var helmet = require('helmet');
  app.use(helmet());
```

### Logging

Handle logging using morgan

1.  Using `morgan` that is, install it:-

    `yarn add morgan`

2.  In code when setting up Express add:-

```
  var morgan = require('morgan');
  app.use(morgan("dev"));
```
